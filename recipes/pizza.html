      >Pizza dough as it is made in Italy. When I first moved to Italy, I was
      surprised to see that deciding to eat a pizza for dinner meant whipping up
      pizza dough with a few common ingredients a couple of hours before. Using
      fresh, compressed yeast, it rises in an hour. Stretchy, chewy, and so full
      of flavor, there's no need to order out. This dough works for calzone as
      well as focaccia, and the recipe doubles perfectly!</i

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>3 ¾ teaspoons fresh, compressed yeast</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to the lowest setting possible.</li>
      <li>
        Combine 4 cups flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with
        the dough hook attachment; turn mixer on low speed. Crumble yeast into
        small pieces and add to the flour. Slowly pour in water. Scrape the
        sides to make sure all flour is incorporated and mix until dough begins
        to pull away from the sides and form a ball. Drizzle in oil and mix
        until fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead on low speed for 5 or 6 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons extra
        flour if needed. Remove dough from the bowl and use your hands to form a
        ball. Return dough to the bowl and score the top with an "x." Cover with
        a damp cloth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn oven off and place dough in the oven to rise for at least 1 hour,
        or up to 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove dough from the oven and reattach the bowl to the stand mixer.
        Uncover and punch down dough. Knead on low speed for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place a pizza stone or tray on the bottom oven rack and
        preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut dough into 4 equal pieces and roll each one into ball. Dust with
        flour if needed. Place balls on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth.
        Roll out each ball into a 9-inch circle and top with desired toppings
        (no more than 1 cup sauce per pizza).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pizza on the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Immediately lower
        the temperature to 410 degrees F (210 degrees C) and bake for 10 to 12
        minutes; actual length of time will depend on your toppings. Repeat to
        make remaining pizzas.
      </li>
    </ol>
